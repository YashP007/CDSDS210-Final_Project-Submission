# CDSDS210-Final_Project-Submission
Yash Patel (U11247717)

Hello, 

This is my final project for CDS DS210: Programming for Data Science. The data that was used was a list of spotify tracks, artist, and playlists. The data was organized by which song is in which playlist, with this data the artist information was provided. With this algorithim I aimed to create graph data from the choosen data and then create an algorithm that would recamend a playlist to listen to based on a given playlist that is enjoyed. Since the purpose of this project is to perform some analysis of graph data that submitted files are not the entire recamendation software, because the given playlist is hard coded into the program. The motivation behind this alogorthm was to create a more effient and effective method for playlist recamendation. Many songs and user created playlists based on the content of the songs perform much better than playlists created from style and artist. So by using the taste and how users group songs together a more powerful and better recommendation engine can be built. This recommendation engine can benefit and recommend playlists to users more efficiently.

My choosen data //  python programming

### Data Parsing & Generating HashMap Adjacency Lists
My submitted program goes through a series of graphs to interpolate a better recamendation. Initally a graph tree was created with the nodes being the playlist and the nodes it pointed to being the artists it contains. I used a HashMap<String, Vec<String>> to store this graph data, the data was stored in the format of a adjacency list. I parse through the data set, which was sampled to a size around 500,000 lines. For each line of data, I checked if the node for the playlist was created, if it was not I use the HashMap .insert() function to add a new node (key), with the value being the artist in a Vec<String> format. If the playlist node was already created then I find the value using the node name as the key loop up, I then check if the value contains the artist that is presented in the line of the data sheet. If the artist is in the value vector, then I do nothing, if it is not, then I add the artist into the value vector. Using this logic I parse through my entire data file, and generate a HashMap with the key's being the Playlists and the values being a list of the artists the playlist features. I repeate this processes in reverse.
