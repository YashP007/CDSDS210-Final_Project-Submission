# CDSDS210-Final_Project-Submission
Yash Patel (U11247717)

Hello, 

This is my final project for CDS DS210: Programming for Data Science. The data that was used was a list of spotify tracks, artist, and playlists. The data was organized by which song is in which playlist, with this data the artist information was provided. With this algorithim I aimed to create graph data from the choosen data and then create an algorithm that would recamend a playlist to listen to based on a given playlist that is enjoyed. Since the purpose of this project is to perform some analysis of graph data that submitted files are not the entire recamendation software, because the given playlist is hard coded into the program.
